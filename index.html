<h4>Why Art Flair?<h4>
    <p> Art flair is a business that provides all people of the world resources such as ;documents,past papers (IGCSE -IBDP),graded assignments, courses,workshops,showcases, university application and, scholarships. Art Flair has recognised that trying to pursue  a career in acting is very frustrating at times, these people with big dreams of becoming the next actor/actress are mocked and not taken seriously regularly  for choosing a career path different from what society deems fit to be a career. Because of this backward thinking there has been not effort by the government to provide facilities for people who have an interest in acting, resources are restricted, limiting the full potential of individuals. Our business is here to fight the system and give people who aspire to be actors/actresses the same level of seriousness that white collar jobs are given.
